### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my master in Data Science at Stevens Institute of Technology.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Tensorflow & Pytorch. 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new data science project. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about experience in data science.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I found not everyone learn things the same way it supposed to be, people all have their unique way to learn new things in the most effective way.
